Climate change is a systems problem. Managing climate risk requires infrastructure investments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to changes in extreme events. These investment strategies need to account for deep uncertainty and complex dynamics across sectors and between the natural and human systems. They affect stakeholders with diverse values and preferences, and have the potential to increase equity, resilience, and justice.

Our research group focuses on the role of environmental and socioeconomic uncertainties in shaping the efficacy of climate risk management strategies. Our interdisciplinary, mission-oriented research addresses a broad set of problems, from flood risk management to energy-system investments and draws on tools from systems engineering, decision science, data science, and economics.
