## Abstract

The variability and intermittency of renewable energy sources pose several challenges for power systems operations, including energy curtailment and price volatility. In power systems with considerable renewable sources, co-variability in renewable energy supply and electricity load can intensify these outcomes. In this study, we examine the impacts of interplay between renewable resource and load co-variability and power system constraints across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We use the New York State power system as our case study, which is undergoing a major transition toward increased renewable generation. We characterize the spatiotemporal co-variability of renewable energy-generating resources and electricity load and investigate the impact of climatic variability on electricity price volatility. We use an accurate, reduced-form representation of the New York power system, which integrates additional wind and solar power resources to meet the stateâ€™s energy targets through 2030. Our study shows while diversifying renewables mitigates power variability, short-term fluctuations can still lead to inefficient energy use and substantial curtailment. Annual electricity prices varied by 9%, with price spikes fluctuating by up to 56%, while reflecting a state-wide heterogeneity. Hydropower primarily influences yearly prices, whereas solar and wind mainly affect short-term volatility. Our results underscore the importance of considering both spatiotemporal dynamics and system constraints when planning investments in renewable energy infrastructure.
