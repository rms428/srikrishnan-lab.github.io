## Course Description

Environmental systems involve multiple interacting processes, uncertainties, and potentially conflicting objectives. These dynamics can complicate analyses which focus on a single component of the system, such as an individual pollution source, or a single outcome of interest. In this course, we will adopt a systems approach to environmental quality modeling and management, including applications in air and water pollution control and solid waste management. In particular, we will:

* define systems and their boundaries;
* simulate system dynamics using computer models;
* formulate and solve decision problems for systems management;
* analyze and assess risk; and
* make decisions under uncertainty.
