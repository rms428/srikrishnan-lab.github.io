## Teaching Materials & Philosophy

I believe in creating open-source teaching materials with an emphasis on reproducibility and strive for my course materials to be high-quality and accessible. As a result, all materials for my core courses are publically available online with an open source license (either an MIT license for code or a Creative Commons license for educational content). If you have any questions or suggestions on this content, please [email me](mailto:vs498@cornell.edu) or raise an issue on the associated GitHub repository.
